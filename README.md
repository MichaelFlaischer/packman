# Pacman Game

## Introduction

Welcome to the Pacman Game! This is a classic arcade game where you control Pacman, the yellow character, and your goal is to eat all the food on the board while avoiding ghosts. If Pacman eats a ghost while in super mode, the ghost disappears temporarily, and you earn points.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move Pacman: up, down, left, and right.
- Pacman will continue moving in the direction you press until it hits a wall or changes direction.
- Eat all the regular food dots and cherries on the board to win points.
- Avoid colliding with ghosts, as it will result in a game over unless Pacman is in super mode.

## Points Calculation

- Eating regular food dots: Each regular food dot eaten earns you 1 point.
- Eating cherries: Eating a cherry earns you 10 points.
- Eating ghosts in super mode: If Pacman eats a ghost while in super mode, you earn 50 points.
- Winning the game: If you eat all the food dots and cherries on the board, you win the game.
- Losing the game: The game ends if Pacman collides with a ghost while not in super mode.
